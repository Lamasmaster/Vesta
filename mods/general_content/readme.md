## Welcome to EPNo5's general content package.

## About
Nebula, the base code we run, is designed to be very modular. Because of that, content can easily be added and removed via 'modpacks', which are their own .dme projects, which are included in a map's _defines.dm.
This means when compiled, this extra content will be included into the compiled package - or removed from it. Or you can overwrite something. It's a very clean, modular system if you use it properly.
There will be a link to the *other* modpack we also have, which is our ship to ship combat pack.
